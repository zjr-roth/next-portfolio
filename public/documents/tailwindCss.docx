** Tailwind CSS 


***** BENEFITS 

- You aren’t wasting energy inventing class names. No more adding silly 
class names like sidebar-inner-wrapper just to be able to style something, and 
no more agonizing over the perfect abstract name for something that’s really 
just a flex container.

- Your CSS stops growing. Using a traditional approach, your CSS files get 
bigger every time you add a new feature. With utilities, everything is reusable 
so you rarely need to write new CSS.

- Making changes feels safer. CSS is global and you never know what you’re 
breaking when you make a change. Classes in your HTML are local, so you can 
change them without worrying about something else breaking.


***** IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UTILITY CLASSES AND INLINE STYLES 

- Designing with constraints. Using inline styles, every value is a magic 
number. With utilities, you’re choosing styles from a predefined design system, 
which makes it much easier to build visually consistent UIs.

- Responsive design. You can’t use media queries in inline styles, but you can 
use Tailwind’s responsive utilities to build fully responsive interfaces easily.

- Hover, focus, and other states. Inline styles can’t target states like hover 
or focus, but Tailwind’s state variants make it easy to style those states with 
utility classes.
